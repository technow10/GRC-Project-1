# PURPOSE 

The purpose of this proposal is to engage SecureTech to design and implement a cybersecurity program aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to enhance governance, risk management, and compliance capabilities at MedSure Healthcare Services. The program will address cybersecurity risks associated with remote work environments and third-party vendors, while ensuring compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, including HIPAA and HITECH.

Given the critical nature of MedSure’s operations, maintaining the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of data and systems is essential. This initiative will establish a secure, reliable, and resilient cybersecurity posture that protects the MedSure platform against evolving threats, supports business continuity, ensures regulatory compliance, and reinforces stakeholder and customer trust.
